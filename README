Download and process data on county-to-county migration from the IRS. Downloads all years, populates a PostgreSQL database and constructs a view useful for comparing the in- and out-flow of a pair of counties side by side. It uses Postgres because an outer join is necessary.

This goes up to the 2008-2009 year, but you'll only need to modify one line to add in the name of new years as they become available.

If you don't want to run this script yourself but just want some data, there's a CSV here:

This Python script and Postgres views were created for use in a Washington Times article.
